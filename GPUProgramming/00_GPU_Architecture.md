# GPU ARCHITECTURE - Gentle Intro to GPUs
> This aims to give you a bit of introduction about GPUs, why we use it for learning tasks, why is it faster than the CPU at certain tasks

## Hardware

- CPU : central Processing Unit
	-	General purpose
	- 	High clock speed
	-	Few cores
	- 	High Cache
	- 	low latency
	-	low throughput

- GPU : Graphical Processing Units
	- Specialised
	- Many cores
	- Low cache
	- High Latency
	- High throughput

- TPU : Tensor Processing Units
	-	Specialised GPUs for deep learning algorithms

- FPGA : Field Programmable Gate Array
	- Specialised hardware that can be reconfigured to perform specific tasks
	- very low latency
	- very large throughput
	- high energy consumption

## What's making GPUs so fast for deep learning?

- A ton of cores with control units and L1 cache.
