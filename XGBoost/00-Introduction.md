## How XGBoost Works

### Gradient Boosting Framework
1. **Sequential Learning**: Models are trained sequentially, each correcting errors of previous models
2. **Gradient Descent**: Uses gradients of the loss function to optimize predictions
3. **Tree Ensembles**: Combines multiple decision trees for final predictions
4. **Additive Training**: Each new tree is added to minimize the overall loss

### Mathematical Foundation
```
Objective = Loss Function + Regularization Term
F(x) = Î£ f_k(x), where f_k is the k-th tree
```

### Key Innovations
- **Second-order Approximation**: Uses both first and second derivatives
- **Regularization**: Built-in L1 and L2 regularization terms
