# Introduction to XGBoost

## What is XGBoost?

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library that implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. At its core, XGBoost is a mathematically sophisticated ensemble method that builds predictive models by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Gradient Boosting Framework

XGBoost operates on the principle of gradient boosting, where the model is built iteratively by adding new predictors that correct the errors made by previous predictors. The mathematical formulation is:

```
F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + γ_m * h_m(x)
```

Where:
- `F_m(x)` is the model after m iterations
- `h_m(x)` is the m-th weak learner (base model)
- `γ_m` is the step size (shrinkage parameter)

### Objective Function

XGBoost optimizes a regularized objective function that consists of a loss function and regularization terms:

```
Obj = Σ L(y_i, ŷ_i) + Σ Ω(f_k)
```

Where:
- `L(y_i, ŷ_i)` is the loss function measuring the difference between true and predicted values
- `Ω(f_k)` represents regularization terms that control model complexity
- The regularization term is: `Ω(f) = γT + ½λ||w||²`

### Second-Order Optimization

Unlike traditional gradient boosting that uses only first-order derivatives, XGBoost leverages **second-order Taylor expansion** for optimization:

```
Obj^(t) ≈ Σ [L(y_i, ŷ_i^(t-1)) + g_i*f_t(x_i) + ½h_i*f_t²(x_i)] + Ω(f_t)
```

Where:
- `g_i = ∂L(y_i, ŷ_i^(t-1))/∂ŷ_i^(t-1)` (first-order gradient)
- `h_i = ∂²L(y_i, ŷ_i^(t-1))/∂ŷ_i^(t-1)²` (second-order gradient/Hessian)

This second-order information allows XGBoost to:
- Converge faster than first-order methods
- Make more informed decisions about tree structure
- Achieve better approximation of the optimal solution

### Tree Learning Algorithm

XGBoost uses a novel tree learning algorithm that:

1. **Exact Greedy Algorithm**: Enumerates all possible splits for optimal tree construction
2. **Approximate Algorithm**: Uses quantile-based candidate splitting for scalability
3. **Weighted Quantile Sketch**: Handles weighted datasets efficiently
4. **Sparsity-Aware Split Finding**: Automatically handles missing values

The optimal split finding criterion is:

```
Gain = ½[G_L²/(H_L+λ) + G_R²/(H_R+λ) - (G_L+G_R)²/(H_L+H_R+λ)] - γ
```

Where G and H are sums of gradients and hessians for left (L) and right (R) splits.

## Key Mathematical Innovations

### 1. Regularization
XGBoost incorporates both L1 and L2 regularization:
- **L1 (Lasso)**: `α * Σ|w_j|` - promotes sparsity
- **L2 (Ridge)**: `λ * Σw_j²` - prevents overfitting

### 2. Column Subsampling
Inspired by Random Forests, XGBoost samples features at:
- Tree level (`colsample_bytree`)
- Split level (`colsample_bylevel`)
- Node level (`colsample_bynode`)

### 3. Shrinkage and Row Subsampling
- **Shrinkage**: Scales newly added weights by factor η (learning rate)
- **Row Subsampling**: Uses random subset of training instances

### 4. Handling Missing Values
XGBoost learns optimal default directions for missing values during training, making it robust to incomplete data.
